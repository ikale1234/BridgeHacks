# BridgeHacks Project
## Where Do I Throw It

This is a Hack-a-Thon Project for BridgeHacks. This was created using pygame,
and is a game that helps people figure out what bin they should throw items 
they are disposing. The file containing the finished game is called where_do_I_throw_it_game.py,
and it is the file you should run to play the game. The rest of the files were used to aid in 
collaboration for the game or they contain the images and sounds implemented into the game.
